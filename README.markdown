ColorTouch
----------

Created at iOSDevCamp 2011, this example answers the question, "How can I create oddly-shaped touchable regions?" The short answer is, "By painting them!"

* Dependencies: iOS 4

LineDraw
----------

Created to clarify the fundamentals of view drawing with Quartz. Draw simple filled polygons by tapping. Buttons available to clear everything, undo the last tap, or remove the entire last polygon.

* Dependencies: iOS 4
* Universal for iPhone & iPad

TouchCards
----------

Demonstrates positionable views that can "flip" using a Core Animation transition.

* Dependencies: iOS 4
